# How do I report a bug?

Bugs should be reported here [in the github issues section](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/mpfb2/issues)

In general, this information should always be included:

- From when is the version you are using? I.e, did you download it today or is it a few days or weeks old?
- On what platform are you running blender?
- Screenshots clearly showing what the problem is

## Log files

If closer examination is needed, you might be asked for log files. 

On the developer panel you can find panels for increasing the log level and for exporting a log file. 

If you want to help the process along, you could increase the log level to DEBUG, repeat the procedure that caused the bug, export the "default" log file, and
attach this to your bug report.
