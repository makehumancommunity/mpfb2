"""This is the main file for MPFB. For more information about MPFB as a whole, see the README.md file in the zip.

The MPFB code is organized into several key directories, each serving a distinct purpose:

src/mpfb/entities: This directory contains the core data models and logic for different entities used in the project.
Entities represent the main objects or concepts within the application, such as materials, rigs, helpers, and other
domain-specific objects.

src/mpfb/services: The services directory contains the core logic of the project. The files contain utility classes and functions
that provide various services to the rest of the application. These services are typically stateless and provide reusable
functionality. Examples of services include logging, node management, location services, and system services. These services help in
abstracting and encapsulating common operations that can be used across different parts of the application.

src/mpfb/ui:
The ui directory is responsible for defining the user interface elements of the add-on. This includes panels, operators, and other
UI components that are integrated into Blender's interface. The UI components interact with the rest of the application, allowing
users to perform actions and configure settings through Blender's graphical interface.

src/mpfb/data:
The data directory contains static resources and data files used by the project. This can include 3D object files, textures, configuration
files, and other assets required for the add-on to function. These resources are typically loaded and used by the entities and services to
provide the necessary functionality within Blender.

The root of the project (ie this file) is the entry point for the Blender add-on. It loads and initializes the necessary modules and services.
It also exposes a few important functions and objects:

- get_preference(): Return a preference key from the MPFB preference panel
- VERSION: A tuple representing the version of MPFB
- BUILD_INFO: Build information of MPFB. It defaults to "FROM_SOURCE" if not a build, otherwise it contains the build date
- DEBUG: A boolean indicating whether debug mode is enabled. If DEBUG is True, some early initialization info is printed to the console
- MPFB_CONTEXTUAL_INFORMATION: A dictionary containing contextual information of the addon, such as in which package it was loaded
- ClassManager: A singleton object that manages the registration and unregistering of classes such as panels and operators

    Retrieve a preference value from the MPFB preference panel.
